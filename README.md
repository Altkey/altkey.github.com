# Arthur Tucker/Mars11's Website ###############################################

This repository contains the full codebase of my website.

It is currently on a non free license, which means you are neither permitted to
use this work for anything else, unless you received explicit permission by me.

## Setup #######################################################################

directory as the site.

## What Am I Doing? ############################################################

Basically, I'm showing off what I can do. While also getting some practice.
